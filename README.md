# Welcome to My Cloud Journey as a newbie ... somewhat ü§î

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Me

Hello there! Before I tell you about my journey learning Azure Cloud, let me first say I'm Kevoy Walters, an admirer of C# and .NET. I currently have over 3 years of professional expereince in the telecommunications and financial industries. I've had the privilege of working on a variety of projects with so many exceptional and brilliant people.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Embracing New Horizons 

While I've always had a deep love for traditional software development, I recently embarked on an exciting journey that led me into the realms of cloud development and DevOps. The dynamic and ever-evolving nature of these fields intrigued me, and I decided to dive headfirst into learning more about them.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Discovering Cloud Development and DevOps

As I delved into cloud development and DevOps, I realized the immense potential they hold to revolutionize the way we can build, deploy, and manage applications. The ability to scale effortlessly, ensure high availability, and streamline development workflows through automation left me both fascinated and inspired. I already had a close realtionshp with Micsoroft's primary programming language C# so I decided what better way to keep it in the family than using **Microsoft Azure** to satisify my curiosity.

## üÜï The Birth of a New Project

To put my newfound passion and knowledge into practice, I embarked on an exciting project. This project was not just another coding exercise; it was a chance for me to immerse myself in cloud development and DevOps concepts. I intentionally designed the project in a way that forced me to utilize these principles, pushing me out of my comfort zone and into uncharted territory.
The point of this project is not focus on its features but how those features are deployed,hosted and managed in the Cloud through Azure.
The project focuses on using the following Azure Cloud Services:
1. **App Configuration** _for appsettings and connection string centralization_
2. **App Services** _platform as a service (PAAS) solution that offers hosting capabilities for apps ruuning on multiple frameworks. The framework used to developed this proejct was .NET 6 LTS._
3. **API Managament** _service for publishing, securing and managing our web services_
4. **Storage Accounts (Table Storage)** _for storing and accessing our data through partitions and keys_

## üí° What to Expect in This Repository

In this GitHub repository, you'll find the result of my endeavors. I've documented my journey, sharing insights, challenges, and solutions that I encountered along the way. You'll find code snippets, configuration files, and perhaps even a few 'Aha!' moments that I experienced as I navigated through cloud services, containerization, continuous integration, and more.
